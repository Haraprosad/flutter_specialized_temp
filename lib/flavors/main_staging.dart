/// - **Performance Testing**: Test app performance under production-like conditions
/// 
/// ### Client Demonstrations
/// - **Stable Environment**: More stable than development for client presentations
/// - **Latest Features**: Showcases upcoming features before production release
/// - **Real Data**: Uses production-like data structures and volumes
/// - **User Acceptance Testing**: Allows stakeholders to validate features
/// 
/// ### Pre-Production Validation
/// - **Release Candidate Testing**: Test builds before production deployment
/// - **API Compatibility**: Validate against staging API endpoints

/// - **App Icon**: Staging-specific app icon with distinctive branding
/// 
/// ## Staging-Specific Features
/// 
/// ### Logging & Monitoring
/// - **Reduced Logging**: Less verbose than development but more than production
/// - **Analytics**: Full analytics implementation for behavior tracking
/// - **Crash Reporting**: Complete crash reporting to identify issues
/// - **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics collection
/// 
/// ### API Configuration
/// - **Staging Endpoints**: Dedicated staging API endpoints

/// 
/// ## CI/CD Integration
/// 
/// ### Automated Testing
/// ```yaml
/// # GitHub Actions example for staging deployment
/// name: Deploy to Staging
/// on:
///   push:
///     branches: [develop]
/// jobs:
///   deploy-staging:
///     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
///     steps:
///       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
///       - name: Build Staging
///         run: flutter build apk -t lib/flavors/main_staging.dart --release
///       - name: Deploy to Firebase App Distribution
///         uses: wzieba/Firebase-Distribution-Github-Action@v1
/// ```
/// 
/// ### Staging Deployment Pipeline
/// - **Automatic Deployment**: Deploy to staging on develop branch commits
/// - **Testing Suite**: Run automated tests against staging builds
/// - **Notification System**: Notify QA team of new staging deployments
/// - **Rollback Capability**: Quick rollback to previous staging version
/// 
/// ## Environment Differences from Production
/// 
/// ### Development Features Retained
/// - **Enhanced Logging**: More detailed logging than production
/// - **Debug Information**: Some debug information for troubleshooting
/// - **Feature Flags**: Ability to toggle features for testing
/// - **Mock Services**: Some services may use mock implementations
/// 
/// ### Production Features Simulated
/// - **Performance Optimization**: Production-level optimizations enabled

/// - **Analytics**: Full analytics and tracking implementation
/// - **Error Handling**: Production-level error handling and recovery
/// 
/// ## Security Considerations
/// 
/// ### Staging-Safe Features
/// - **Staging API Keys**: Separate API keys for staging services
/// - **Test Databases**: Isolated staging databases with test data
/// - **Limited Access**: Restricted access to staging environment
/// - **Data Privacy**: Anonymized or synthetic data for testing
/// 
/// ### Production Parity
/// - **Security Protocols**: Same security protocols as production
/// - **Authentication**: Full authentication implementation
/// - **Data Encryption**: Production-level encryption testing
/// - **Privacy Compliance**: GDPR/privacy regulation compliance testing
/// 
/// ## Troubleshooting
/// 
/// ### Common Issues
/// 1. **Environment File**: Ensure `.env.staging` exists and is configured
/// 2. **API Connectivity**: Verify staging API endpoints are accessible
/// 3. **Authentication**: Check staging authentication service availability
/// 4. **Data Sync**: Ensure staging database is up-to-date
/// 
/// ### Debug Tools Available
